**Challenge:** Revconcatalternate

## New Concepts Explained

### 1. Numeric operations and type conversion

Go supports various numeric types: `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `float32`, `float64`.

Common operations:
- `%` (modulo) for remainders
- `/` for division (integer division truncates)
- Type conversion: `int(x)`, `float64(x)`

### 2. Slice manipulation and operations

Slices are dynamic, flexible views into arrays. They're the most common data structure in Go:

```go
// Create a slice
numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

// Slice an existing slice
subset := numbers[1:4]  // [2, 3, 4]

// Append to a slice
numbers = append(numbers, 6)
```

Slices have length (current elements) and capacity (max elements without reallocation).

### 3. Go function definition and usage

Functions in Go are defined using the `func` keyword. They can take parameters and return values:

```go
func FunctionName(param1 type1, param2 type2) returnType {
    // function body
    return result
}
```

The `main()` function is special - it's where program execution begins.

### 4. Looping constructs (for, range)

Go has only one looping construct: the `for` loop. It can be used in several ways:

```go
// Traditional for loop
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ { }

// While-style loop
for condition { }

// Range loop (for collections)
for index, value := range collection { }
```

For strings, `for...range` iterates over runes, making it safe for UTF-8.
