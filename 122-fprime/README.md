# 122-fprime

## fprime

### Instructions

Write a program that takes a positive `int` and displays its prime factors, followed by a newline (`'\n'`).

- Factors must be displayed in ascending order and separated by `*`.

- If the number of arguments is different from 1, if the argument is invalid, or if the integer does not have a prime factor, the program displays nothing.

### Usage

```console
$ go run . 225225
3*3*5*5*7*11*13
$ go run . 8333325
3*3*5*5*7*11*13*37
$ go run . 9539
9539
$ go run . 804577
804577
$ go run . 42
2*3*7
$ go run . a
$ go run . 0
$ go run . 1
$
```

## Time limit

**20 minutes** (round 1). Beat it on every repeat — each spaced round targets a shorter time as the solution moves into long-term memory.

## Blind rule

No docs, no search, no AI, no copying. Close `skills.md`, close the reference solution, turn off autocomplete if you can. Write every line from memory — that is the whole point.

## How to check

From the repo root:

```bash
go run ./cmd/drill check 122
```

or run the tests directly:

```bash
go test ./122-fprime/
```

Green means done. Red means read the failure message, fix from memory, check
again.

## Repeat schedule

Redo this challenge from scratch after **1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 21 days**.
Each round, start the timer with `go run ./cmd/drill start 122` and beat your
previous time. `go run ./cmd/drill due` tells you what is due today.
