**Challenge:** Stringfilter

## New Concepts Explained

### 1. String iteration and character access

In Go, strings are immutable sequences of bytes encoded in UTF-8. You can iterate over them using `for...range` which gives you runes (Unicode code points) rather than bytes.

```go
for _, char := range myString {
    // char is a rune (int32)
}
```

To access individual characters, you can also use indexing, but remember that `s[i]` returns a byte, not a rune. For UTF-8 safety, use `for...range`.

### 2. String filtering and cleaning

Filtering strings involves:
- Iterating through characters
- Checking conditions (is space? is digit? etc.)
- Building a new string with only wanted characters

```go
var result strings.Builder
for _, c := range s {
    if condition(c) {
        result.WriteRune(c)
    }
}
```

### 3. Go function definition and usage

Functions in Go are defined using the `func` keyword. They can take parameters and return values:

```go
func FunctionName(param1 type1, param2 type2) returnType {
    // function body
    return result
}
```

The `main()` function is special - it's where program execution begins.

### 4. Conditional logic and boolean returns

Go uses `if/else` for conditional branching. The condition doesn't need parentheses:

```go
if condition {
    // do something
} else if otherCondition {
    // do something else
} else {
    // default case
}
```

Boolean operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).
