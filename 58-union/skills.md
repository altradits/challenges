**Challenge:** Union

## New Concepts Explained

### 1. String iteration and character access

In Go, strings are immutable sequences of bytes encoded in UTF-8. You can iterate over them using `for...range` which gives you runes (Unicode code points) rather than bytes.

```go
for _, char := range myString {
    // char is a rune (int32)
}
```

To access individual characters, you can also use indexing, but remember that `s[i]` returns a byte, not a rune. For UTF-8 safety, use `for...range`.

### 2. Conditional logic and boolean returns

Go uses `if/else` for conditional branching. The condition doesn't need parentheses:

```go
if condition {
    // do something
} else if otherCondition {
    // do something else
} else {
    // default case
}
```

Boolean operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).
